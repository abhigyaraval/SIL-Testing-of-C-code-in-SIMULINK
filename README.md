# SIL-Testing-of-C-code-in-SIMULINK
Test model for C-SIMULINK integration for AFCP testing.

The Simulink model roughly simulates a liquid propulsion engine. C-Caller blocks are used for deploying function blocks of source code written in C. The specific physics of the model
are not as important as the function of open/close valve, therefore more focus is spend on ensuring sensor read and valve actuations.
